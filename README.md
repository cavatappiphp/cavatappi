# Cavatappi PHP Framework

A way to build applications and domain models with sane defaults instead of magic conventions.

## Installation

For objects and interfaces that can help form a domain model, use Foundation:

```shell
composer require cavatappi/foundation
```

For implementations and serialization tools for the application layer, use Infrastructure:

```shell
composer require cavatappi/infrastructure
```

And for utilities to make testing suck less, use Testing:

```shell
composer require --dev cavatappi/testing
```
