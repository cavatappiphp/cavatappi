# Contributor Agreement

## About Pull Requests

Pull request templates are coming soon, but the basic idea is

1. Run the fixer. Use your IDE or `composer lintfix`.
2. Run the linter. Use your IDE or `composer lint`.
3. Write tests for new code.
4. Make sure tests for existing code pass. Only change those tests if there is a change in those classes, and then very carefully. Use `composer test`.

## About Copyright

We are not currently asking for copyright assignment or any contributor license agreement. We are asking that the code
be provided under the Apache license (same as the project).

On behalf of the Lasagna PHP project, we sincerely thank you for your contributions.
