# Cavatappi Walkthrough

It's not a tutorial, mostly because this is me solving a personal problem and bringing you, the reader, along for the
ride. This is happening in near-real-time, so there might be some hiccups along the way.

For this, I'll be making a backend for a web version of my iOS app, [PillTimer](https://pilltimer.app). It's a simple
app that tracks medicine doses and calculates when your next dose is. It's the kind of simple but feature-complete app
I hope that Cavatappi can excel at, so lets give it a shot!

1. **[Setup](01-setup.md)**  
   Initialize Composer and install the packages.
2. **[Values](02-values.md)**  
   Learn about how Value objects work in Cavatappi.

More chapters to come as the app and framework mature.
