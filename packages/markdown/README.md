## Philosophy

As this is a wrapper around an already highly-configurable library, this can be used to essentially make whatever flavor
of Markdown you want, need, or think you need. We do encourage you to consider the original goals for Markdown:

> The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with
> tags or formatting instructions.

As such, adherence to any similar formatting specs should be considered an implementation detail, not an intentional
choice.
